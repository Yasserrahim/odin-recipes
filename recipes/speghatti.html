<h2> Description</h2>
<p> Muggine bottarga (cured mullet roe) is an ancient traditional food from the island of Sardinia in Italy. I have enjoyed this treat for so many years I just had to share it with you.
     A classic pasta dish from Italy becomes a specialty by adding bottarga to it. Enjoy!</p>
<h3> Ingerdients</h3>
<ul>
    1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti

    Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste
    
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    
    1 red chile pepper, seeded and minced
    
    2 ounces grated Sardinian mullet bottarga, divided
    
    4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
    
    1 small lemon, zested 
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    Step 1
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.

Step 2
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.

Step 3
Add garlic to the oil and cook until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and stir together, reducing the temperature to medium-low. Continue stirring. The garlic should never become dark brown or crispy. If this has happened, the garlic is burnt and no longer appropriate for consumption.

Step 4
Drain the pasta, reserving at least 1 cup pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the oil mixture, still on medium-low heat. Stir or toss until all the spaghetti is well coated. Add 3/4 of the bottarga and stir to mix with the spaghetti, adding the reserved pasta water to hydrate as needed. There should be a little "sauce" when serving but not soupy.

Step 5
Divide onto 4 plates and sprinkle with chopped parsley and lemon zest; squeeze lemon juice over and sprinkle remaining bottarga on top right before serving.
